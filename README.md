# Atom TextBuffer Core - .NET Standard
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/x3haloed/text-buffer-net-standard.svg)](https://david-dm.org/x3haloed/text-buffer-net-standard)

This is the core of the Atom text buffer, separated into its own module so its tests can be run headless, and ported to .NET Standard. It handles the storage and manipulation of text and associated regions (markers).
